Observations:

1. There is a strong correlation (0.84) between mouse weight and average tumor volume for mice on the Capomulin drug regimen. 

2. Mouse r944's tumor volume significatly decreased over time while on the drug regimen Capomulin. 

3. Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be much better drug regimens than Infubinol and Ceftamin since the final tumor volume for these mice were much lower when on these drug regimens.
